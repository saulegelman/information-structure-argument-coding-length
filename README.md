Purpose of the research:
To explore how the interaction between preferred information ordering and the associations between semantic role and information status affects the length of argument coding across typologically diverse languages​​.

Research question:
Do less frequent, hence less predictable, information structure patterns lead to longer argument coding?

Method:
Quantitative analysis of data from the Multilingual Corpus of Annotated Spoken Texts (Multi-CAST, available online at https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de/). The method involves selection and coding of clauses for information structure variables and measuring clause length in graphemes.

Type of research data:
The research data consist of spoken language corpora from 14 typologically diverse languages​​.

Data processing steps:
1. Selection of clauses.
2. Coding of clauses for information structure variables: information status and order.
3. Measurement of clause length in graphemes.
4. Compilation and statistical analysis of the dataset​​.

Type of analyses conducted:
A GLMM with a negative binomial distribution was fitted to the data, with clause length as response, information order and status as fixed effects, and a random intercept for corpus. An additional GLMM was fitted with a random slope of information order within corpus.
